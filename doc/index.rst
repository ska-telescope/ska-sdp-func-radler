Radler: Radio Astronomical Deconvolution Library
================================================

Radler is a library providing functionality for deconvolving astronomical images. The library was split off from `WSClean <https://gitlab.com/aroffringa/wsclean>`_ in order to enhance modularity and comparisons.

Documentation
-------------

This manual describes Radler-specific documentation, which includes how to interface with Radler from Python or C++.
Information about the different methods and when to
use which method (aimed at astronomers) can be found in `the WSClean manual <https://wsclean.readthedocs.io/>`_. The WSClean documentation also contains references to scientific papers that describe the methods that are implemented
in Radler.
